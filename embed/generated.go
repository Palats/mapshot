	"# Mapshot for Factorio\n" +
	"\n" +
	"*Mapshot* generates zoomable screenshots of Factorio maps - **[example](https://palats.github.io/mapshot-example/)**.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"They can be created in 2 ways:\n" +
	"\n" +
	"* Through a regular Factorio mod, providing an extra command to create a mapshot.\n" +
	"* Through a CLI tool generating a mapshot of any saved game - without having to activate mods on your game. Factorio is " + // cont.
	"used for rendering.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"The generated zoomable screenshots can be explored through a web browser, using the CLI tool to serve them. As those map" + // cont.
	"shots are exported as static files (html, javascript, jpg), they can also be served through any HTTP server - see below." + // cont.
	"\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Some simple layers are generated - currently it is possible to show train stations and map labels (chart tags).\n" +
	"\n" +
	"***Warning: Generation can take quite a while. Factorio UI will appear frozen during that time; this is normal.***\n" +
	"\n" +
	"See https://github.com/Palats/mapshot for more details.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Installing\n" +
	"\n" +
	"The Factorio mod can be installed like any other mod from the Factorio UI.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"The optional CLI is used for serving generated mapshots and generating mapshots from outside the game. The standalone bi" + // cont.
	"naries can be downloaded from https://github.com/Palats/mapshot/releases; then:\n" +
	"\n" +
	" * Linux: Mark as executable if needed and run - this is a standard command line tool.\n" +
	" * Windows: For convenience, if the `.exe` file is launched directly from Explorer, it will automatically start the serv" + // cont.
	"ing mode. Otherwise, you need a way to give the tool parameters - either by launching it from the `cmd` console, or by c" + // cont.
	"reating a shortcut (with extra parameters in the properties).\n" +
	" * MacOS: A binary is provided (\"darwin\" version), but is completely untested as I have no access to a MacOS system.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Creating a mapshot\n" +
	"\n" +
	"### In Factorio\n" +
	"\n" +
	"In the Factorio [console](https://wiki.factorio.com/Console), run:\n" +
	"```\n" +
	"/mapshot <name>\n" +
	"```\n" +
	"\n" +
	"It will create a website in the Factorio [script output directory](https://wiki.factorio.com/Application_directory#User_" + // cont.
	"data_directory), in a subdirectory called `mapshot/<name>/`. If `<name>` is not specified, a name based on the seed and " + // cont.
	"current tick will be generated (modding API does not gives access to savename, hence no good default naming).\n" +
	"\n" +
	"### With the CLI\n" +
	"\n" +
	"To generate a mapshot:\n" +
	"\n" +
	"```\n" +
	"./mapshot render <savename>\n" +
	"```\n" +
	"where `savename` is the name of the save you want to render. It will not modify the file - specifically, despite mod usa" + // cont.
	"ge, it will not impact achievements for example. This will run Factorio to generate the mapshot - let it run, it will sh" + // cont.
	"ut it down when finished. As with the regular mod, the output will be somewhere in the `script-output` directory.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"If your Factorio data dir or binary location are not detected automatically, you can specify them with `--factorio_datad" + // cont.
	"ir` and `--factorio_binary`. You can also override the rendering parameters - see CLI help for the specific flag names.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Steam version of Factorio is not supported for now. If you have only a Steam version, you can still get a standalone ver" + // cont.
	"sion on factorio.com by linking your Steam account.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"### Parameters\n" +
	"\n" +
	"You can tune parameters such as many layers to generate, their resolution and a few more details. Those parameters are:\n" +
	"\n" +
	"* ... in Factorio per-player mod settings interface (in the menu, `settings/Mod settings/Per player`).\n" +
	"* ... command line arguments for the CLI.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Parameters:\n" +
	"\n" +
	"* _Area_ (`area`) : What to include in the mapshot. Options:\n" +
	"  * `entities` [default]: Include all chunks which contain at least one entity of some interest. This should capture the" + // cont.
	" base in practice.\n" +
	"  * `all`: All chunks.\n" +
	"* _Smallest tile size_ (`tilemin`) : Indicates the number of in-game units the most detailed layer should contain per ge" + // cont.
	"nerated tile. For example, if it is set to 256 while the \"Tile Resolution\" is 1024, it means that the most detailed laye" + // cont.
	"r will use 4 pixels (=1024/256) per in-game tile. Many assets in Factorio seem to allow for up to 64 pixels per game til" + // cont.
	"e - so, to have the maximum resolution, you will want to have \"Smallest tile size\" set to 16 (=1024/64) - careful, that " + // cont.
	"is slow.\n" +
	"* _Largest tile size_ (`tilemax`) : Number of in-game units per generated tile for the least detailed layer. See `tilemi" + // cont.
	"n` for more details. Mapshot will generates all layers from `tilemax` to `tilemin` (included).\n" +
	"* _Prefix to add to all generated filenames._ (`prefix`) : Mapshot will prefix all files it creates with that value. Fac" + // cont.
	"torio mods only allow writing within `script-output` subdirectory of Factorio data dir; the prefix is relative to that d" + // cont.
	"irectory.\n" +
	"* _Pixel size for generated tiles._ (`resolution`) : Size in pixels for the generated images. There is not a lot of reas" + // cont.
	"ons to change this value - if you want more or less details, change `tilemin`.\n" +
	"* _Pixel size for generated tiles._ (`jpgquality`) : Compression quality for the generated image.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"*Warning: the generation time & disk usage increases very quickly. At maximum resolution, it will take forever to genera" + // cont.
	"te and use up several gigabytes of space.*\n" +
	"\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Serving the generated content\n" +
	"\n" +
	"The CLI can be used to serve the mapshots:\n" +
	"\n" +
	"```\n" +
	"./mapshot serve\n" +
	"```\n" +
	"\n" +
	"By default, it serves on port 8080 - thus accessible at http://localhost:8080 if it is running on your local machine. It" + // cont.
	" serves all the mapshots available in the `script-output` directory of Factorio. It provides a very basic list of availa" + // cont.
	"ble mapshots and refreshes this list every few seconds.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"The generated content is made of static files. This means you can also serve the content through any HTTP server (e.g., " + // cont.
	"`python3 -m http.server 8080` from the `script-output` directory) or your favorite web file hosting.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"\n" +
	"## Development\n" +
	"\n" +
	"### Running as a live mod\n" +
	"\n" +
	"The files in a checkout of the repository can be used directly by Factorio. This allows to a quick edit/test cycle. For " + // cont.
	"that, simply your checkout from the Factorio `mods` directory under the name `mapshot`.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"To avoid having to regenerate Lua files when modifying the html part of the plugin, link `viewer.html` from `script-outp" + // cont.
	"ut`. Load `viewer.html` in your browser and add `?path=mapshot/<name>` to look directly at one of the generated map.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Files in `embed/` and `generated.lua` are automatically generated from other files of the repository; to regenerate them" + // cont.
	":\n" +
	"```\n" +
	"go generate ./...\n" +
	"```\n" +
	"\n" +
	"### The CLI\n" +
	"\n" +
	"To run it from a checkout of the repository:\n" +
	"```\n" +
	"go generate ./... && go run mapshot.go <parameters...>\n" +
	"```\n" +
	"\n" +
	"By default, it will show the help, including all the available subcommands.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"### Releasing\n" +
	"\n" +
	"* Update changelog\n" +
	"* Update version in: `changelog.txt` (incl. date), `mod/info.json`, `frontend/package.json`\n" +
	"* Regenerate files: `go generate ./...`\n" +
	"* Test build release: `./build.sh`\n" +
	"* Commit and push\n" +
	"* Create release in Github\n" +
	"* Update Factorio mods portal (new zip, update doc)" +

	"    - `go generate` runs properly on Windows.\n" +
	"    - Build script for releases.\n" +
	"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n" +
	"Version: 0.0.4\n" +
	"Date: 2020.09.20\n" +
	"  Features:\n" +
	"    - Capture automatically only the base by default. This avoids generating lots of useless tiles.\n" +
	"    - Host freely accessible example of generated output.\n" +
	"  UI:\n" +
	"    - Control for showing/hiding layers. For now, used for hiding debug info.\n" +

	"Version: 0.0.3\n" +
	"Date: 2020.09.20\n" +
	"  Fixes:\n" +
	"    - Naming of the output from the mod command was ignoring the parameter.\n" +
	"  CLI:\n" +
	"    - Added a \"mapshot dev\" to run Factorio with the mod setup for a dev workflow.\n" +
	"    - Choice of work directory if desired.\n" +
	"  Internal:\n" +
	"    - Split commands implementations.\n" +
	"    - Moved mod code to its own subdirectory, and reworked generator location.\n" +
	"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n" +
	"Version: 0.0.2\n" +
	"Date: 2020.09.14\n" +
	"  Features:\n" +
	"    - CLI to automatically create mapshot without impacting saves (incl. achievements).\n" +
	"  Fixes:\n" +
	"    - Fixed mod command registration (it was not registered in some cases).\n" +
	"    - Changed default max details to something prettier (and still not too slow).\n" +
	"  Internal:\n" +
	"    - Added a command line tool.\n" +
